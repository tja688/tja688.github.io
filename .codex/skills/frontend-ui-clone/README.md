# frontend-ui-clone

A Claude Code skill that clones any website into a pixel-perfect, self-contained HTML file.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/instantX-research/skills --skill frontend-ui-clone
```

Or manually copy into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
cp -r skills/frontend-ui-clone ~/.claude/skills/
```

## What It Does

Uses Playwright to render the target page in a real Chromium browser, then directly extracts the rendered DOM + all computed CSS. No manual rewriting — the original DOM and original CSS are always more accurate than any reconstruction.

```
URL ──► Playwright render ──► Extract DOM + CSS ──► Assemble .html ──► Screenshot compare ──► Fix & verify
```

## The Frontend Skill Family

This skill is part of a three-skill pipeline. Each skill handles a different stage of the website-to-product workflow:

```
                ┌─────────────────────┐
                │   frontend-ui       │  Generate from scratch
                │   (design + code)   │  "Build a landing page for..."
                └─────────────────────┘

                ┌─────────────────────┐
  URL ────────► │  frontend-ui-clone  │ ────────► clone.html
                │  (pixel-perfect)    │           (single file)
                └─────────────────────┘
                                                      │
                                                      ▼
                                          ┌─────────────────────┐
                                          │  frontend-reactor   │ ────────► Next.js project
                                          │  (componentize)     │           (npm run dev)
                                          └─────────────────────┘
```

| Skill | Role | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| [**frontend-ui**](../frontend-ui/) | Design + generate new UI from scratch | Text description, reference URL, screenshot | Production-ready HTML/TSX |
| **frontend-ui-clone** | Pixel-perfect website cloning | URL | Self-contained `.html` file |
| [**frontend-reactor**](../frontend-reactor/) | Convert static HTML to React project | Clone `.html` file(s) or URL | Runnable Next.js project |

**Typical workflows:**

- **Clone & convert:** `/frontend-ui-clone https://linear.app` → `/frontend-reactor clone-linear.html`
- **Clone multiple pages, then convert:** Clone several pages → `/frontend-reactor clone-linear*.html`
- **URL shortcut:** `/frontend-reactor https://linear.app` (auto-clones homepage, then converts)
- **Design from scratch:** `/frontend-ui a SaaS landing page` (no cloning — generates original UI)

## Usage

```
/frontend-ui-clone https://example.com
```

Or ask naturally:

- "Clone this site: https://example.com"
- "Make a pixel-perfect copy of https://example.com"
- "Replicate this URL as a single HTML file"

## Strategy Levels

The skill auto-detects available tools and selects the best extraction strategy:

| Level | Method | Fidelity | When |
|-------|--------|----------|------|
| **1** | Playwright DOM + CSS | ~97% | Default for most sites |
| **1a** | Hybrid (CSS + targeted overrides) | ~90% | Tailwind `important:true` sites |
| **1b** | Targeted style bake | ~80% | When 1a still fails |
| **2** | Firecrawl + CSS download | ~85% | No Playwright |
| **3** | gstack/browse + CSS | ~80% | No Playwright or Firecrawl |
| **4** | WebFetch + reconstruction | ~70% | HTTP fetch only |
| **5** | WebSearch research | ~50% | Last resort |

Auto-escalation: Level 1 → 1a → 1b happens automatically if the hero section is blank after extraction.

## Key Features

- **Zero creative liberty** — reproduces exactly what exists, never redesigns
- **Self-contained output** — single `.html` file, no external dependencies
- **Automatic CSS custom property extraction** — captures all `:root` variables (Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui)
- **Gradient text preservation** — bakes `background-clip: text` gradients as inline styles
- **Inner scroll container detection** — handles SPA layouts with `fixed inset-0` wrappers
- **CSS animation override** — forces scroll-reveal animations to their visible end state
- **Invisible overlay removal** — detects and removes SPA editor/chat panels covering content
- **Lazy image fix** — strips `loading="lazy"`, fixes `data-lazy-src`, resolves `/_next/image` URLs
- **Font preservation** — extracts `<link>` tags for Google Fonts and font preloads
- **Screenshot comparison** — Playwright-based visual diff with iterative fixing

## Requirements

Best results with **Playwright** installed:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

Falls back gracefully to Firecrawl, gstack/browse, WebFetch, or WebSearch if Playwright is unavailable.

## Output

Files are written to `test_outputs/clone-[domain].html`:

```
test_outputs/
  clone-lovable.html      # 816 KB — lovable.dev clone
  clone-wondering.html    # 329 KB — wondering.app clone
```

## Known Limitations

- **JS-rendered-on-scroll content** — elements that only exist in the DOM after JS scroll interaction cannot be captured in a static clone
- **Interactive components** — accordions, tabs, modals render in their extraction-time state
- **Cross-origin iframes** — blank from `file://`, work when deployed to a web server
- **Responsive breakpoints** — Level 1b (style bake) loses responsive CSS; Level 1/1a preserve it
- **Typewriter animations** — captured as static text unless prompts are detected and injected

## Lessons Learned

The skill encodes 30 lessons from real cloning sessions in its Key Lessons section, including:

- `networkidle` timeout fallback for SPA/Next.js sites
- Large invisible overlay panel detection and removal
- CSS custom properties as the #1 fidelity killer
- `section { height: auto }` killing hero `min-h-screen`
- `@import` rule ordering in `<style>` blocks
- Inner scroll container scrolling for animation triggers
- CSS `animate-*` classes stuck at initial state
